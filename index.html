    <text>
        Hi, my name is Alexis Guevara! I was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA
        and am a freshman student at Occidental College in Los Angeles, CA.
        I aim to major in Mathematics and minor in Computer Science since I am intrigued
        in certain subjects, such as algebra, artificial intelligence, robotics and engineering.
        I also have interests in areas like Music and Latin American Studies.
